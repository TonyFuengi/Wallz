In this project it has developed an adaptation of a classic cryptosystem, known as Guyotâ€™s cryptographer into current mobile technology by creating a mobile application for Android devices with which codification from text to music can be made in real time, generating MIDI files which can be played in the device and allowing the decoding of these files.

Furthermore, it has been introduced a new text codification key allowing the encryption of extra characters based on the Do Mayor scale, and allowing the user to create their own text encryption key too.
